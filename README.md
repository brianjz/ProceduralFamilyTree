# Procedurally Generated Family Tree

Since I am a genealogist in my free time, I thought a fun side-project would to be see if I can have a system that creates procedurally-generated family trees.

This may be useful in another setting or game in the future.

This is the main class that can be called by other applications. Currently, there is an API for it at [Procedural Family Tree API](https://github.com/brianjz/ProceduralFamilyTreeAPI)

# To Do
- More control and more details
- Other output type projects: GEDCOM, Family Group Sheets, etc
